# In RPGs, players have points to spend on their character attributes. Create
# a function that returns the total number of points players have spent on
# their characters. The function will receive a map containing the strength,
# dexterity, and intelligence values. Each point in strength should be 
# multiplied by two, and dexterity and intelligence should be multiplied by three.
